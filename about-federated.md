# About federated solutions
The **IBM Blockchain Document Store** service enables organizations to run federated
instances of any IBM Blockchain Solution. A federated instance is essentially a clone
of the master solution instance, which allows organizations to manage their solution
users and applications privately and confidentially on the federated instance.

Support for federated solutions facilitates what is otherwise a complex architectural
challenge for blockchain network administrators, as follows:

- A solution defined as a master instance is shared by multiple federated instances
- A single user login provides access to all federated instances
- Organizations within the federation store blockchain credentials on their own instance, rather than on the master.
- Organizations can be migrated from any wallet manager in the federated solution to any other wallet manager in the federated solution

Figure 1. below depicts the concept of federated solutions. The organization is
running a clone (federated instance) of the master solution and managing users and
applications on their federated instance.
