# Service overview

**IBM Blockchain Document Store** is a comprehensive document management service for **IBM Blockchain Platform** business networks. This SaaS offering, on IBM Cloud, enables IBM business partners and clients to accelerate  adoption of enterprise blockchain networks.

The Blockchain Document Store service includes the **IBM Blockchain Solution Manager** component, which enables  organizations to easily manage blockchain networks, solutions, services, and users.

## Why use Blockchain Document Store?
On legacy business networks, document management can be a time-consuming process that slows down the pace of business. Transactions that depend upon uploading, verifying, and sharing documents can be delayed for extended periods while multiple parties spend resources ensuring that documents and versions are accurate and consistent. This problem is further complicated when there is manual document processing involved.

**IBM Blockchain Document Store** securely and efficiently archives and shares all classes of business documents, including certificates, contracts, purchase orders, licenses and titles. Virtually any file format can be quickly and easily uploaded and shared with authorized parties, from a single service, using a common, intuitive interface. Blockchain Document Store also provides document verification to ensure that content is accurate and current. The end result is unprecedented savings in time, effort, and cost for IBM Blockchain enterprise organizations and users.

## What does Blockchain Document Store do?
The **IBM Blockchain Document Store** service provides generic secure services for managing and sharing all types and classes of business documents, as well as monitoring related metadata and network events. Any transaction that involves a document, including uploading, viewing, verifying, and sharing, is recorded on the shared blockchain ledger as a permanent, immutable transaction. Documents (files) are stored off blockchain, in network object storage.

The following business-critical features are built into the **Blockchain Document Store** service:
- Secure management of high-value business documents, such as trade agreements, mortgage contracts, regulatory certificates, ownership titles, and other mission-critical classified documents.
- Immutable blockchain data with secure encoded links to documents stored off-chain in a secure, highly-scalable distributed database.
