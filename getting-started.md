# Getting started
To get started with the **IBM Blockchain Document Store** service, you will meet
the prerequisites for your organization to manage documents (on-chain and off-chain)
on any [IBM Blockchain Platform ![External link icon](images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/blockchain/){:new_window} network. These prerequisites include configuring the **Blockchain Solution Manager** component of the service to manage your networks, solutions, applications, and users.

## Before you begin
To get started with **Blockchain Document Store**, you will need
both an [IBMid ![External link icon](images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/account/us-en/signup/register.html){:new_window} and an
[IBM Cloud account ![External link icon](images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/){:new_window}. A subscription to an  [IBM Blockchain Platform plan ![External link icon](images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/blockchain/){:new_window} is also required for your organization to initiate or join an **IBM Blockchain Platform** network on IBM Cloud.

Once you have met these prerequisites, you are ready to connect your
**IBM Blockchain Document Store** instance to a network member organization,
as follows:

1. Create an instance of [Blockchain Document Store ![External link icon](images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/blockchain-document-store){:new_window} for your organization. (One instance of the service is required per organization, per network channel.) Your new service instance will be listed on your [IBM Cloud Dashboard ![External link icon](images/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.bluemix.net/dashboard/apps){:new_window}.

2. [Configure the service](configure-service.html)

3. [Authorize the service](authorize-service.html)

4. [Install and instantiate the service](install-instantiate.html) (This step is done automatically for you.)

Once you have connected your **Blockchain Document Store** service instance to another member organization, you are ready to connect your applications and solutions to the service.

## What's next?
[Connect an application to the service](register-app.html) or [connect a solution to the service](register-solution.html).
